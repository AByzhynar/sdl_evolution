# SDL Evolution

**Do not submit a proposal without reading this roadmap document.** Ideas should be discussed on the [SDL Slack][sdl_slack] [#sdl_evolution][sdl_evolution_channel] open channel before a proposal is created here.

For more information about SDL, go to [www.smartdevicelink.com](https://www.smartdevicelink.com).

This process and document is based on Apple's excellent [Swift Evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution) process.

This document tracks the ongoing evolution of SDL. Proposals should be made for any public API surface change, that is, any change that would necessitate a minor or major version change in any SDL mobile library. If a protocol or RPC change does not change any API surface, they must still be brought through the proposal process. In sum, the following changes must be proposed:

* Changes necessitating minor or major version updates to the mobile libraries according to [semantic versioning](http://www.semver.org), except those that are caused by a misspelling.
* Major changes (Definition TBD) to SDL Core.
* **Any** change to the SDL Protocol.
* **Any** change to the SDL RPC spec.

Important documents:

* Goals for upcoming SDL releases â€“ this document.
* The [SDL evolution proposal review schedule](https://smartdevicelink.github.io/sdl_evolution/) to see upcoming SDL evolution proposal reviews.
* The [SDL evolution review process](process.md) to see how to propose and review proposals.
