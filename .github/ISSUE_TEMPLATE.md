##### What goes into a review?

The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of SDL. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:

* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to SDL?
* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of SDL?
* If you have used competitors with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?
* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?

Please state explicitly whether you believe that the proposal should be accepted into SDL.
